## Symmetry-adapted Closest Wannier model
Following the closest Wannier method, one can obtain
the closest Wannier functions (CWFs) and the closest Wannier (CW) Hamitonian $H^{\rm (CW)}$.
Then, following the symmetry-adapted modeling in Ref. [hk-prb23], we can decompose the CW Hamiltonian as the linear combination of the symmetry-adapted multipole bases (SAMBs) as
$$
H^{\rm (SymCW)} = \sum_{j} z_{j} \mathbb{Z}_{j}
$$
where $\{z_{j}\}$ denote the weight of each SAMBs and correspond to the the model parameters, obtained by
$$
z_{j} = \frac{1}{N_{k}} \sum_{\bm{R}} \mathrm{Tr}\left[H^{\rm (CW)}(\bm{R}) \mathbb{Z}_{j}(-\bm{R}) \right]
$$
Here $N_{k}$ is the number of $k$ points.
