## CH4: Closest Wannier tight-binding model

- Outline: Compute the closest Wannier model and
    the Wannier interpolated band structure of
    ${\rm CH}_{4}$ molecule based on the closest Wannier method
    using hydrogenic atomic $s$ and $p$ orbitals.
    For the detail of the theoretical background, see Ref.[@ozaki-prb24].

- Directory: `tutorials/tutorial01/` *Files can be downloaded from
    [here](https://github.com/CMT-MU/SymClosestWannier/tutorials/tutorial01)*

- Input files
    - `ch4.cwin`:  *The input file for `pw2cw`*

    - `ch4.win`:  *The input file for `wannier90.x`*

    - `ch4.nnkp`: *The output file of crystal data generated by `wannier90.x`*
    
    - `ch4.eig, ch4.amn`: *The output files generated by `pw2wannier.x`* or `VASP2WANNIER`* or `WIEN2WANNIER`*

1. Calculate overlapes between Kohn-Sham orbitals and pseudo atomic orbitals based on the Plane-Wave (PW) DFT calculation softwares, such as [QuantumEspresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) and [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/).
The following files are used for the next step.
   - seedname.win, seedname.nnkp, seedname.eig, seedname.amn (generated by [Wannier90](https://wannier.org/))
    (additional files: seedname.mmn, seedname.spn, seedname.uHu, seedname.uIu, ...)

2. Run `pw2cw` to create Closest Wannier tight-binding model.
    ```bash title="Terminal"
    pw2cw ch4
    ```

    Since ${\rm CH}_{4}$ is molecule, the disentanglement is not necessary, `disentanglement` can be specified in `ch4.cwin` as
    ```vi title="Input file"
    disentangle = false
    ```

    To get the Closest Wannier Hamiltonian matrix elements in real-space, `write_hr` can be specified in `ch4.cwin` as
    ```vi title="Input file"
    write_hr          = .true.
    ```
    
- Output files:
    - `ch4.cwout`: *The standard output*
    - `ch4.hdf5`: *calculation information and data for CWModel*
    - `ch4_hr.dat.cw`: *Closest Wannier Hamiltonian matrix elements in real-space $H(R)$ (in this case, $H(0)$)*
    - `plot_band.gnu`: *The gnuplot script to compare DFT and Wannier bands*
    - `ch4/`
        - `ch4_hr_sym.dat`: *Symmetry-adapted Closest Wannier Hamiltonian matrix elements in real-space*
        - `ch4_z.dat.cw`: *The expansion coefficients of the Hamiltonian matrix expressed by a linear combination of SAMBs*
        - `ch4_s.dat.cw`: *The expansion coefficients of the Overlap matrix expressed by a linear combination of SAMBs*
        - `ch4_n.dat.cw`: *The expansion coefficients of the Electronic density matrix expressed by a linear combination of SAMBs.*
