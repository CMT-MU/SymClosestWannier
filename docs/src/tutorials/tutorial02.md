## Graphene: Closest Wannier tight-binding model

- Outline: Compute the closest Wannier model and
    the Wannier interpolated band structure of
    graphene based on the closest Wannier method
    using hydrogenic atomic $p_{z}$ orbitals.
    For the detail of the theoretical background, see Ref.[@ozaki-prb24].

1. Calculate overlapes between Kohn-Sham orbitals and pseudo atomic orbitals based on the Plane-Wave (PW) DFT calculation softwares, such as [QuantumEspresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) and [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/).
The following files are used for the next step.
   - seedname.win, seedname.nnkp, seedname.eig, seedname.amn (generated by [Wannier90](https://wannier.org/))
    (additional files: seedname.mmn, seedname.spn, seedname.uHu, seedname.uIu, ...)

2. Run `pw2cw` to create Closest Wannier tight-binding model.
    ```bash title="Terminal"
    pw2cw graphene
    ```
